"""Concrete tools the agents call to act in the real world.

Many tools touch macOS-native surfaces (Calendar, Messages, Contacts) or send
real email. To keep the assistant runnable in CI, on non-macOS machines, and in
the hosted "Try as Guest" demo, every such tool checks :data:`DEMO_MODE` and
simulates the action instead of performing it.

Set ``DESIR_DEMO=0`` in the environment to perform real actions.
