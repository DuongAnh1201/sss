"""Concrete tools the agents call to act in the real world.

Some tools touch macOS-native surfaces (Messages, Contacts), some call cloud APIs
(Resend for email, Google Calendar), and some are local (knowledge base). To keep
the assistant runnable in CI, on non-macOS machines, and in the hosted "Try as
Guest" demo, every such tool checks :data:`DEMO_MODE` and simulates the action
instead of performing it.

Set ``MONEYPENNY_DEMO=0`` in the environment to perform real actions.
