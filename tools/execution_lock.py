"""The execution lock — the hard-coded gate around every real-world side effect.

Implements Phase 1 §4 of docs/consent-architecture/01-consent-gate.md.

The rule: a side-effecting tool wrapper (the function that physically hits
Resend, the macOS Calendar, Messages, the filesystem, ...) MUST call
``require_consent(action_type)`` before it acts. The *only* code path that grants
consent is ``ai.agents.consent.gate``, which opens a ``consent_scope`` carrying a
valid Consent_Token *after* it has recorded the user's approval.

If a tool runs outside that scope — e.g. the orchestrator hallucinates and calls a
sensitive tool directly, bypassing the ProposedAction/consent step — there is no
active grant and ``require_consent`` raises :class:`ConsentError`. The system fails
closed: no token, no effect.

The grant is propagated via a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar`, which
``asyncio.to_thread`` copies into worker threads, so synchronous tool wrappers run
under the same scope as the awaiting gate.
