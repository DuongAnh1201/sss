"""REAL Google Drive integration test — opt-in, hits your actual Drive.

This is skipped by default. It only runs when ALL of these are true:

  1. ``RUN_GOOGLE_INTEGRATION=1`` is set (explicit opt-in),
  2. demo mode is OFF (``MONEYPENNY_DEMO=0``), and
  3. you've connected Workspace with a Drive scope (token on disk).

How to run it (PowerShell):

    # one-time: enable the Drive API + set OAuth client, then connect with a Drive scope
    $env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."; $env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
    $env:MONEYPENNY_DEMO="0"
    uv run python run_text.py --connect      # choose Drive: "file" (least privilege) is enough

    # then run the live round-trip
    $env:RUN_GOOGLE_INTEGRATION="1"; $env:MONEYPENNY_DEMO="0"
    uv run pytest tests/workspace/test_google_drive_integration.py -v -s

What it does (and cleans up after itself):
  create a file  ->  read it back  ->  update it  ->  read again  ->  move to Trash.

The ``drive.file`` scope (least privilege) is sufficient: the test only touches the
single file it creates. Sharing is NOT exercised here (it would email a real person);
see ``test_share_roundtrip`` which is separately gated on ``GOOGLE_TEST_SHARE_EMAIL``.
